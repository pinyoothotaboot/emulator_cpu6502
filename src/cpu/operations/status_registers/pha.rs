     * PHA - Push Accumulator On Stack
        Operation: Aâ†“

        This instruction transfers the current value of the accumulator to the next location on the stack, automatically decrementing the stack to point to the next empty location.

        The Push A instruction only affects the stack pointer register which is decremented by 1 as a result of the operation. It affects no flags.
