    * SEC - Set Carry Flag
       Operation: 1 â†’ C

       This instruction initializes the carry flag to a 1. This op eration should normally precede a SBC loop. It is also useful when used with a ROL instruction to initialize a bit in memory to a 1.

       This instruction affects no registers in the microprocessor and no flags other than the carry flag which is set.
