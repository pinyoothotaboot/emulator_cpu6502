     * CLI - Clear Interrupt Disable
        Operation: 0 â†’ I

        This instruction initializes the interrupt disable to a 0. This allows the microprocessor to receive interrupts.

        It affects no registers in the microprocessor and no flags other than the interrupt disable which is cleared.
