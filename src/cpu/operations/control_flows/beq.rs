    * BEQ - Branch on Result Zero
       Operation: Branch on Z = 1

       This instruction could also be called "Branch on Equal."

       It takes a conditional branch whenever the Z flag is on or the previÂ­ ous result is equal to 0.

       BEQ does not affect any of the flags or registers other than the program counter and only then when the Z flag is set.

       t: =1 if branch is taken.
